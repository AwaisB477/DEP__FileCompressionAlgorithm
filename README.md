# File Compression and Decompression Tool
This C++ project provides a basic tool for compressing and decompressing files using Run-Length Encoding (RLE). The tool reads a file, compresses its contents using the RLE algorithm, and writes the compressed data to a new file. It also supports decompression.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a basic file compression and decompression tool using the Run-Length Encoding algorithm. The tool handles reading and writing files, compressing and decompressing data, and managing edge cases.

## Key Features
- Compression: Compresses file contents using Run-Length Encoding (RLE).
- Decompression: Decompresses RLE encoded files back to their original format.
- Error Handling: Provides error messages for file operations.
## Setup
### Clone the Repository:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the project directory.
### Create a Sample Input File:

- Create a text file named input.txt with the content you want to compress.
## Compilation
### Compile the Program:
- Use a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) to compile the source files.
- Ensure you have the necessary development tools installed.
## Running the Program
### Compress a File:

- Run the compiled executable.
- Choose the option for compression.
- Enter the name of the input file (e.g., input.txt).
- Enter the desired output file name (e.g., compressed.txt).
### Decompress a File:

- Run the compiled executable.
- Choose the option for decompression.
- Enter the name of the compressed input file (e.g., compressed.txt).
- Enter the desired output file name (e.g., decompressed.txt).
## Dependencies
- C++ Standard Library: For file handling and string manipulation.
