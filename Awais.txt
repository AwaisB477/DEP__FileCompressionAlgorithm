My name is Awais Raza and I am student at NUST in Department of Electrical Engineering. Studying in NUST was a great 
experience and I enjoyed studying here. Now I think I will choose my career path in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence which make me very attractive and now a days I am learning Machine Learning and I will do some solid projects before ending of my summer vacations InshAllah.
